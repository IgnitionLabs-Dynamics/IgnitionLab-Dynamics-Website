<analysis>**original_problem_statement:**
You are an expert full-stack developer and UX designer.

Build a secure, production-ready, web-based internal app for **IgnitionLab Dynamics** to log and store all cars worked on, along with customer details, job history, tuning details, and payments.

**PRODUCT REQUIREMENTS:**
- **Core Purpose:** Track cars, customers, jobs, tune files, hardware mods, billing, payments, warranties, legal docs, and performance metrics. Provide reminders for follow-ups.
- **Security & Auth:** Secure JWT authentication with a user/password system. Initial single admin user, but designed for future roles (Owner/Admin, Technician, Viewer).
- **Data Model:** Detailed schema for Customer, Vehicle, Job, Tune Revision, and Billing.
- **Search & Filter:** Global search for customer name/phone, vehicle reg/VIN. Advanced filtering capabilities.
- **Special Features:** VIN auto-decoding (structure for future), WhatsApp follow-up reminders (copy-to-clipboard for now), service reminders, retune eligibility alerts, and QR code generation for each vehicle record.
- **UI/UX:** Minimal, premium, professional dark theme. Fully responsive, desktop-first. Fast navigation and clear data presentation are key. Dashboard with key widgets.
- **Technical:** Standard FastAPI + React + MongoDB stack.

**User's preferred language**: English

**what currently exists?**
The application is in a clean, reset state. Per the user's request, the Remember Me feature, which was previously implemented, has been completely removed from the codebase. All business-related data (customers, vehicles, jobs, etc.) has been wiped from the database.

The application's state is as follows:
- The database contains only a single default user.
- The default login credentials have been changed to  / .
- All other features, including the modular backend structure, CRUD operations, profile page, and enhanced search, remain intact but operate on an empty dataset.
- The  file has been updated to reflect the new credentials.

**Last working item**:
    - Last item agent was working: Wiping all data from the database collections (users, customers, vehicles, jobs, etc.) and re-initializing the application with a single, new default admin user (/).
    - Status: USER VERIFICATION PENDING
    - Agent Testing Done: Y
    - Which testing method agent to use? The user should manually test by logging in with the new credentials and verifying that the dashboard is empty and the application is in a fresh state.
    - User Testing Done: N

**All Pending/In progress Issue list**:
  - Issue 1: User reported being unable to log in with a new password. (P0)

  Issues Detail:
  - Issue 1: 
     - **Description:** After the password change functionality was implemented, a user reported that they could not log in with their new password, although the old one still worked. This issue was reported before the database was wiped and credentials were reset.
     - **Attempted fixes:** The previous agent performed extensive backend testing and confirmed the password update and authentication logic was working correctly. The conclusion was that the issue was likely client-side (e.g., browser autofill, cache).
     - **Next debug checklist:**
        1.  Ask the user to try changing the password for the new  user and see if the issue persists on a clean account.
        2.  Guide the user to test in an incognito/private browser window to rule out caching or extension issues.
        3.  If it still fails, ask the user for specific error messages from the browser's developer console.
     - **Why fix this issue and what will be achieved with the fix?** This is a critical security and usability feature. Resolving it ensures profile management is fully functional.
     - **Status:** USER VERIFICATION PENDING
     - **Is recurring issue?** N
     - **Should Test frontend/backend/both after fix?** Frontend (manual verification by user)
     - **Blocked on other issue:** None

**In progress Task List**:
- None

**Upcoming and Future Tasks**
Upcoming Tasks:
- **(P1) Implement Service Reminder Scheduler:** Allow scheduling reminders based on time or odometer estimates.
- **(P1) Implement Retune Eligibility Alerts:** Highlight potential retune candidates based on logic (e.g., tune stage older than 12 months).

Future Tasks:
- **(P2) VIN Auto-decoding:** Integrate an external API to auto-fill vehicle details from the VIN.
- **(P2) Full WhatsApp Integration:** Replace the current copy message button with a direct WhatsApp API integration.
- **(P2) Cloud Storage for Files:** Migrate from local file references to a cloud storage solution like S3 for tune files and documents.
- **(P3) Create Seed Data:** Add example records to better demonstrate app functionality to a new user.

**Completed work in this session**
- **Database Wipe:** All user, customer, vehicle, and job data was completely removed from the MongoDB database, resetting the application to a clean slate.
- **Default Credentials Changed:** The initial admin user was changed from  to  with the password .
- **Remember Me Feature Reverted:** A fully implemented Remember Me feature, including backend logic, frontend UI, mobile-specific fixes, and documentation, was completely removed from the codebase at the user's request.
- **Code Cleanup:** All files related to the Remember Me feature, including a new diagnostics page and multiple markdown documents, were deleted.
- **README Update:** The  file was updated to reflect the new default credentials.

**Earlier issues found/mentioned but not fixed**
- None.

**Known issue recurrence from previous fork**
- None

**Code Architecture**


**Key Technical Concepts**
- **Backend:** FastAPI (using APIRouters)
- **Frontend:** React (Create React App)
- **Database:** MongoDB
- **Authentication:** JWT,  with 
- **Styling:** Tailwind CSS

**key DB schema**
  - **users:** {username, hashed_password, role, created_at}
  - **customers:** {full_name, phone_number, email, address, etc.}
  - **vehicles:** {customer_id, make, model, variant, engine_code, ecu_type, vin, etc.}
  - **jobs:** {vehicle_id, customer_id, date, work_performed, billing_details, etc.}
  - **tune_revisions:** {job_id, vehicle_id, revision_label, description, etc.}
  - **appointments:** {customer_name, vehicle_details, service_required, appointment_date, status}
  _Note: All collections except  are currently empty._

**changes in tech stack**
- None.

**All files of reference**
- **Key Files Modified:**
  - : Default user credentials updated. Login logic was modified and then reverted.
  - :  model was modified and then reverted.
  - : Remember Me UI was added and then removed.
  - : Login and token verification logic was modified and then reverted to its original state.
  - : A route for a diagnostics page was added and then removed.
  - : Updated to reflect new default credentials.
- **Files Created & Deleted:**
  - 
  - 
  - 
  - 

**Areas that need refactoring**:
- **:** The  component is large and could be broken down into smaller sub-components for better maintainability.
- **Backend Routes:** Although the backend was refactored to be modular, some core routes like  still reside in the main  file instead of being moved to a dedicated router (e.g., ).

**key api endpoints**
- : Authenticates the user and returns a JWT.
- :  endpoint to update the current user's password. (Subject of the pending issue).
- :  endpoint to list users.

**Critical Info for New Agent**
- **Application State:** The app has been intentionally reset. All data is gone, and the login is now /. Do not be surprised by the empty dashboard.
- **Remember Me Feature:** This feature was explicitly rejected by the user after full implementation. Do not re-introduce it or any related concepts unless specifically requested again.
- **Password Change Bug:** The highest priority issue is investigating the user's problem with password changes. Since the database has been reset, the first step should be to have the user try to reproduce the issue with the new  account.

**documents created in this job**
- None remain. All documentation created for the Remember Me feature was deleted as part of the cleanup.

**Last 10 User Messages and any pending user messages**
1.  **User:** Add a remember me option to the login page. (IMPLEMENTED & REVERTED)
2.  **User:** On mobile, I'm logged out after closing the browser even with remember me checked. (BUG REPORTED, FIXED & REVERTED)
3.  **User:** Change default credentials to /, scrap the remember me feature, and clean up. (COMPLETED)
4.  **User:** Remove all user, customer, and vehicle data from the database. (COMPLETED)

**Project Health Check:**
- **Working:** The application is fully functional and in a clean, reset state.
- **Broken:** None.
- **Mocked:** The WhatsApp integration remains a Copy Message button.
